 1. Sender’s Address 
The display name shows PayPal Support, but the actual email is support@paypal-secure.com—a domain not owned by PayPal. Real PayPal emails come from @paypal.com.

 2. Email Header Discrepancies
Received: shows it originated from a server in a different country or from suspicious IPs not listed in PayPal’s SPF records.

SPF/DKIM/DMARC: would fail or soft-fail, indicating the domain isn’t authorized—clear red flags 
keepnetlabs.com

 3. Suspicious Links or Attachments
Link text "Verify Now" hides the actual URL, e.g., http://paypal.secure-login.xyz/verify.

Hovering reveals a mismatch—leading to a bogus domain designed to capture credentials .

No attachments here, but dangerous attachments often include .zip or .doc with macros.

 4. Urgent or Threatening Language
Words like URGENT, immediately, permanent suspension, and time pressure are classic manipulation tactics to force quick action

.

 5. Mismatched URLs
Visual link text suggests PayPal origin, but cursor shows paypal.verify-user.evil.com—a sign of URL obfuscation attacks 
intezer.com

 6. Spelling or Grammar Issues
The message is short but lacks personalization (e.g., “Dear [Your Name]”), and includes phrases slightly off from typical corporate tone—like “unusual activity” without specifics.
