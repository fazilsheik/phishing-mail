Analysis Steps
1. Sender Address (Spoofing)
Display name reads “PayPal Support” but uses support@paypal-secure.com
Legitimate PayPal emails use @paypal.com.
Spoofed domains are common phishing tricks.

2. Email Headers
Download the full headers (e.g., “Show original” in Gmail).
Use tools like MXToolbox or Google Admin Header Analyzer.

3. Suspicious Links/Attachments
“Verify Now” links to http://paypal.secure-login.xyz/verify

Hovering reveals non-PayPal domain
No attachments here—but phishing may include .zip or macro-enabled docs

4. Urgent Language
Terms like URGENT, immediately, permanent suspension create psychological pressure
These are classic phishing manipulation techniques

5. Mismatched URLs
Link text implies PayPal origin
Actual hover target is paypal.verify-user.evil.com
Indicates obfuscated URL, designed to steal credentials

6. Spelling & Grammar
Generic greeting (“Dear PayPal User”) instead of personalization
Slightly unnatural phrasing
Typos or grammatical slips often indicate illegitimacy
